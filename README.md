# Minigrep

## Description

This is a small rust version of grep (**g**lobally search a **r**egular
**e**xpression and **p**rint). According to
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep), **grep** is a "command-line
utility for searching plain-text data sets for lines that match a regular
expression. Its name comes from the ed command g/re/p (globally search a
regular expression and print), which has the same effect: doing a global search
with the regular expression and printing all matching lines."
